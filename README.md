# relation-bootstrap

<br>

## High level instructions for training a relation classifier:

We assume that cyber entity extracted versions of the documents have already been produced. 

<br>


#### Place the entity extracted, serialized documents (.ser.gz files) in the directory *relation-bootstrap/producedfiles/entityextractedserialized/* .

<br>


#### Run this program:

	*gov.ornl.stucco.PrintPreprocessedDocuments*

It takes the output produced by the entity-extractor in the form of serialized documents and produces text versions of them in 
*relation-bootstrap/producedfiles/entityextractedtext/* .  The three files are called *aliasreplaced*, *entityreplaced*, and *original*.  Details of these filesâ€™ contents can be seen in comments at the top of *gov.ornl.stucco.PrintPreprocessedDocuments.java*.

<br>


#### Run these programs:

	*TrainModel.py original*
	*TrainModel.py aliasreplaced*
	*TrainModel.py entityreplaced*

This program takes the output from the previous program and trains a word2vec model on it.  It then writes a text file called *wordvectors.original* , *wordvectors.aliasreplaced*, or *wordvectors.entityreplaced* into the *relation-bootstrap/producedfiles/models/* directory.  This file containing the vectors learned for each word given the training data.
